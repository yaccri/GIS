----------------------------------------------------------------
Component: SearchRadius.js
----------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
    - Provides an asynchronous function, searchPropertiesInRadius, to fetch properties (or dummy data)
      within a given radius based on provided coordinates.
    - Takes GeoJSON coordinates ([lon, lat]) and search radius (in miles) as inputs.
    - Performs an API call (or returns dummy data on error) and returns the search results.
    
Key Comments:
    - Uses a simple conversion from miles to meters (1 mile = 1609.34 meters).
    - Contains error handling to return dummy results for demo purposes.
    - This module is imported into Map.js and used within handleRadiusChange and map click handling to update search results.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Component: AddressSearch.js (if implemented)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
    - Encapsulates the address search functionality.
    - Manages the search input state, debouncing, and fetching suggestions from the Nominatim API.
    - Can be used standalone (or its logic delegated via a custom hook) to provide an autocomplete search for addresses.
    
Key Comments:
    - Debouncing is implemented using setTimeout with a cleanup effect.
    - Suggestions are updated based on user input.
    - Make sure that the component accepts a placeholder prop to show "Enter an address, neighborhood, city, or ZIP code".
    
----------------------------------------------------------------
Additional Notes:
    - Dummy implementations for functions like generateRandomPointInCircle, exportSavedSearches,
      viewSavedSearch, and searchPropertiesInPolygon that were previously in Map.js are meant to be temporary.
    - Once real implementations are available, update these functions and remove dummy alerts.
    - Each component should be self-contained with clear inputs/outputs so that Map.js acts as an orchestrator
      calling these functions/components.
